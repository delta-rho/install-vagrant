# Tessera with Vagrant #

Vagrant provides a lightweight mechanism to provision a reproducible portable Tessera environment for testing and development.  This is the easiest way to get a local platform-independent single-node VM with the Hadoop-backed Tessera environment installed.

The subdirectories in this repository provide scripts to provision a Tessera Vagrant VM with various versions of Tessera components.  The current recommended environment is `cdh4mr1-rhipe0.74`.

## Provisioning a VM ##
*****

Download and install Vagrant: http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

On a command line, clone this repository:

````
git clone https://github.com/tesseradata/install-vagrant
````

Choose the directory in this repository with the environment you would like, for example

````
cd install-vagrant/cdh4mr1-rhipe0.74
````

This will put you in an environment with CDH4 running MapReduce version 1 and with RHIPE 0.74.

To provision the environment, simply type the following:

````
vagrant up
````
and 
````
vagrant up  | vagrant up --provider=virtualbox | vagrant up --provider=aws
````
for virtual box or aws. 

Once the provisioning has completed

* To work from command line: SSH into the machine with `vagrant ssh`
* To work from RStudio IDE: navigate to `localhost:9787` in your web browser with credentials vagrant:vagrant
* While using cdh5-mr2-Rhipe0.75, to access all HTTP pages on your AWS machine tunnel your traffic the following way `ssh -D 10009 -i key ubuntu@hostname` or `ssh -D 10009 -i key username@hostname`


Unless otherwise noted in the README file for a specific installation, the following Hadoop services are available at the following locations:

* NameNode: `http://localhost:60070`
* JobTracker: `http://localhost:60030`
* TaskTracker: `http://localhost:60060`
